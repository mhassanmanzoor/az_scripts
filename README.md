# Key Components of the Script:
- Source and Destination URLs: Replace placeholders like <source_account>, <container>, <path>, and SAS tokens with actual values.

- AzCopy Options:

  - --recursive: Recursively copies all files and directories.
  - --overwrite: Only overwrites files if the source is newer.
  - --block-size-mb 100: Transfers data in 100 MB chunks.
  - --cap-mbps 500: Limits bandwidth to 500 Mbps.
  - --resume: Enables resumable transfers after interruptions.

- Error Handling: Uses subprocess.run() for executing AzCopy, catching errors with CalledProcessError.

- Logging: The script logs the AzCopy process for troubleshooting using the --log-file option.

# Functionality:
1. Imports:
- subprocess: Runs AzCopy commands.
- os: Handles file and directory operations.
2. Functions:
- execute_azcopy_command(): Runs the AzCopy command and handles errors.
- transfer_azure_storage(): Builds and executes the AzCopy command with specified options like recursive copying, resumable transfers, and logging.
3. Main Function: Calls transfer_azure_storage() to execute the transfer and logs the outcome.

# How to Run:
- Ensure AzCopy is installed and authenticated.
- Replace the placeholders in the script with your Azure storage URLs and SAS tokens.
- Run the script for large-scale data transfers with resumable support and logging.

# Summary:
This Python script automates data transfers between two Azure Storage accounts using AzCopy. It supports resumable transfers, optimized performance, detailed logging, and efficient network usage.




The script can be used for transferring data between Azure Blob Storage containers using AzCopy. However, it cannot directly transfer data between Azure File Shares, Queues, or Tables because AzCopy primarily supports Blob Storage, File Storage, and some other data types, but not for Queue and Table Storage.

Hereâ€™s how you can adapt the script for different Azure storage components:

1. Transferring Data Between Two Blob Containers:
This is the default use case of the script. The script transfers data between two Blob Storage containers.

Example:
Source URL: https://sourceaccount.blob.core.windows.net/container1
Destination URL: https://destinationaccount.blob.core.windows.net/container2
python
Copy code
src_account_url = "https://sourceaccount.blob.core.windows.net/container1"
src_sas_token = "<source_sas_token>"
dest_account_url = "https://destinationaccount.blob.core.windows.net/container2"
dest_sas_token = "<destination_sas_token>"
The script can copy all blobs from container1 to container2 using the --recursive flag to copy directories and files within the container.

2. Transferring Data Between Two File Shares:
Azure AzCopy also supports copying data between Azure File Shares. You can adapt the script to copy files between two Azure File Shares similarly by changing the URLs.

Example:
Source URL: https://sourceaccount.file.core.windows.net/fileshare1
Destination URL: https://destinationaccount.file.core.windows.net/fileshare2
python
Copy code
src_account_url = "https://sourceaccount.file.core.windows.net/fileshare1"
src_sas_token = "<source_sas_token>"
dest_account_url = "https://destinationaccount.file.core.windows.net/fileshare2"
dest_sas_token = "<destination_sas_token>"
In this case, the script can recursively copy all files from fileshare1 to fileshare2 using the same azcopy command structure.

3. Transferring Data Between Two Queues:
Azure Queues are not directly supported by AzCopy. Data from queues would typically need to be handled via code using Azure SDKs or PowerShell scripts, rather than AzCopy.

4. Transferring Data Between Two Tables:
Similar to Queues, Table Storage is also not directly supported by AzCopy. You would need to use other methods like the Azure SDKs (C#, Python, etc.) or Azure Storage Explorer to export and import table data.

Summary of Supported Transfers:
Blob Containers: Supported by the script using azcopy.
File Shares: Supported with minor modifications (use .file.core.windows.net in the URLs).
Queues & Tables: Not supported by AzCopy. For these, you would need to use different tools, like Azure SDKs.
For Azure File Shares and Blob Containers, AzCopy is highly efficient and the script can be easily adapted by simply modifying the URLs as per the storage type.
